# Ultimate Blog
Blog for Ultimate Frisbee players at AUBG. Created for learning & experimenting purposes.

## Installation
1. Fork/Download it.
2. npm install & start
3. Type 'localhost:3000' in your browser and you are good to go!

## Styles
If you have any suggestions on how to style *better*, you are more than welcome to send the ideas &/or sketches here b.g.nuryyev at Gmail (credits are guaranteed). Also, if you are like "OMG, I want to see this/that feature!!!", send me the ideas and you will (hopefully) see them soon added & uploaded (again, credits are guaranteed). 

## What is next?
I am currently wrapping up my studies, but by the mid-May I will refresh the things up (add new features, change styles, and refactor the code). 

## Final notes & Copyleft
Feel free to fork and get your hands dirty.
